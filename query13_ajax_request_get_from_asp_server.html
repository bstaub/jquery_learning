    <!--
    Two commonly used methods for a request-response between a client and server are:
    GET and POST.

    GET - Requests data from a specified resource
    POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource

    GET is basically used for just getting (retrieving) some data from the server.
    Note: The GET method may return cached data.

    POST can also be used to get some data from the server.
    However, the POST method NEVER caches data, and is often
    used to send data along with the request.
